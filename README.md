The document number is a string consisting of letters and numbers (without service characters).
  
  Let this file contain each document number from a new line and no other information
  in the line, only the document number.
  A valid document number must be 15 characters long and begin with the sequence "docnum"
  (hereinafter any sequence of letters/numbers) or "contract" (hereinafter any sequence of letters/numbers).
  Write a program to read information from an input file - the path to the input
  file must be set via the console.
  The program should check the document numbers for validity.
  Valid "docnum" document numbers should be recorded in a single report file.
  Valid "contract" numbers should be recorded in another report file.
  Invalid document numbers should be written to another report file,
  but after the document numbers, you should add information about why this document
  is invalid (incorrect sequence of characters at the beginning / there are
  service characters in the document name and more).
 
  The path to the directory where the document file is stored:
  *src/com/teachmeskills/lesson_14/resource/document/doc.txt*
